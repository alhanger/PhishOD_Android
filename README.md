PhishOD_Android
===============

This is an Android sibling of Alec Gorge's Phish OD iOS application (https://github.com/alecgorge/PhishOD-iOS). Likewise, this also uses the Phish.in API - http://phish.in/api-docs

This project was initially created using Android Studio 0.8.1 on Mac OS X. You can choose "Check out from Version Control" from the main Android Studio dialog and give this repo's HTTPS URL.
